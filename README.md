# IDS_exportation
In this repository are included Indicators of Compromise(IOCs) that can be relevant to export to an Intrusion Detection System such as Suricata or Zeek. These two are the main formats that will be saved into this repository. The repository is updated every 24 hours with the information of a MISP instance configured and deployed by myself. 
At the moment, updates are paused but it can be easily continued by setting up the scenario with simple commands.
